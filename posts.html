Monagas | September 2023 | Calgary, AB Canada</h2></div></header><main><article><div class="ctn-1100 m-auto"><div class="m-b-4x"><p class="d-6">Calgary has very cold winters and hot summers with abundant rain. It is a prairie climate with sunny weather almost all year round. But it is a dry climate â€” and some say, it is bone dry. Yet, we are very fortunate because Calgary is the sunniest city in Canada, with an average 2396 hours, or 333 days, of sunshine yearly; with July being the hottest month with an average temperature of 16.5 degrees Celsius, while January averages minus 7 degrees. The wettest month in Calgary is June, with an average of 80 millimeters of rain. Then again, March is Calgary's snowiest month, with an average of about 23 centimeters of snow.</p><p class="d-6">In contrast, Japan is a rainy country with lots of humidity. The temperature in Kyoto, for example in the month of May, ranges from 24 degrees Celsius to 13 degrees, with an average precipitation level of 154 millimeters. Indeed, Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate, but winters are comparatively cold with occasional snowfall. </p><h3 class="d-6">Landscaping is a seasonal and labor intensive business, with high turnover rates. So, why would you choose to start a Calgary based landscaping company with a focus on traditional Japanese garden design, construction, and maintenance?</h3><p class="d-6">According to one of the sources consulted while planning our business model, a landscaping project in Calgary ranges from $10 thousand to $100+ thousand. Next, we found that the most profitable landscaping business comes from lawn care and maintenance, followed closely by yard cleaning. On the list of services that add more value to real estate properties are deck construction, sprinkler system installation and maintenance, removal of mature or unwanted trees, landscape lighting installation, etc. </p><p class="d-6">Financially speaking, landscaping projects that enlarge living space and require low maintenance while adding beauty to a property rank at the top, and increase a home resale value by 15 percent to 20 percent. For this reason, traditional Japanese style gardening, trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, ponding, etc. adds as much or even more value to your property.</p><h3 class="d-6">Ishidoro Zen Gardens' landscaping services are rooted in Japanese aesthetics with respect to creating a miniature, idealized natural landscape with elements such as water, rocks, plants, stone lanterns, other. We plan to become Calgary's best Japanese landscaping company despite the challenges in creating gardens in Calgary's unique environment. This has been done with great success in Edmonton and Lethbridge; and there are more than 300 public Japanese gardens in North America.</h3><p class="d-6">Specifically, for a Japanese garden in Calgary to be viable, we will select those plants and trees that are native to our geographic setting, and can endure the local climate while still providing the appeal of a traditional Japanese garden and landscape. For example, here in Alberta, for a tranquil space that harmonizes with nature, we have a wide variety of pine trees, shrubs, and ground covering plants that are easy to source at local shops and nurseries. Also, rhododendrons and azaleas have hardy varieties that can last in Calgary. We will provide advice on selecting plants, designing the layout, and maintaining the garden.</p><h3 class="d-6">We see ourselves as the Japanese landscape artists who can provide Calgarians with authentic Japanese style landscaping services. In line with the common principles that guide the design of a Japanese garden, we bring simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature to every single garden design. We do not intend to replicate existing Japanese gardens in Japan or abroad. Instead, we aim at borrowing the local scenery to astonish our clients and customers. Calgary is our enclosure.</h3><p class="d-6">For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. Later on, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees. You are free to create and unite the beauty of Japanese landscaping and gardening one step (or project) at a time.</p><p class="d-6">Now, if you would really like to learn more in depth about how to build your dream Japanese garden and landscape on your own terms, we encourage you to visit this youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/japanesegardentv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Japanese Garden TV" class="u-blue">Japanese Garden TV.</a></p><p class="d-6">Lastly, for a more personalized and quite enriching travel experience without the need to leave the comfort of your home, we highly recommend visiting this youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcaCMKRthylySWijPI8UXgA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Japanese Garden Collection" class="u-blue">Japanese Garden Collection.</a></p></div></div><section class="bg-soft"><div class="flex flex-even flex-wrap flex-gap3"><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-57.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-60.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div></div><div class="p-y3 p-x1"><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Homeowners in Calgary are Looking for More Versatile and Low Maintenance Solutions to Traditional Lawns in their Yards</h2><p class="d-6 tx-c">By Jose G. Monagas | November 2023 | Calgary, AB Canada</p></div><div class="ctn-1100 m-auto"><div class="m-b-4x"><p class="d-6 ">Introducing Japanese gardens and landscaping to residents in Calgary is an exciting venture. In prior years, both the news and the media have consistently reported that a typical household with a lawn consumes in excess of ten thousand gallons of water per year (a phenomenon known as "the hidden water waste in lawn maintenance").</p><h3 class="d-6 ">More interestingly is the fact that in dry climates like Calgary, especially during the hot summer months, many homeowners water their lawns more than necessary in an effort to maintaining their "green" appearance. This undoubtedly leads to a great deal of water waste via evaporation.</h3><p class="d-6 ">Therefore, it is only rational to note that the adoption of dry gardens is nothing but one smart step towards a more sustainable future. Given that a dry garden is a landscape that is specifically created with drought tolerant plants that can survive with little to no irrigation, they are the perfect solution to "the water footprint of lawns in North America".</p><p class="d-6 ">One of the top selling points of this type of landscaping style is the fact that a dry garden requires less care and attention than a traditional lawn; which is just perfect for those homeowners who have limited time and a budget for their upkeeping. This can transform any space into a peaceful retreat within their own homes.</p><h3 class="d-6 ">Fortunately, here in Alberta, we have plants that can thrive in our climate and soil conditions while acting as eco-friendly ground cover. For example, our favorite replacement for lawn includes the "sedum" species (known as "stonecrops") and "woolly thyme" (known as "wild thyme").</h3><p class="d-6 ">Also, by incorporating key features like, for instance, pea gravel, rocks, stones and boulders, homeowners can add great value to the aesthetic appeal of their gardens while reducing the excessive need for water.</p><p class="d-6 ">Japanese and Zen dry gardens are not only aesthetically appealing but also versatile. They can be designed to fit both outdoor and indoor spaces. With their adaptability, and low maintenance costs, they can contribute to increasing a real estate property resale value by 15% to 20%, which makes them a solid alternative for those homeowners who are considering long-term investment opportunities.</p><h3 class="d-6 ">Ishidoro Zen Gardens Inc. firmly believes there is beauty in austerity. Therefore, we design, build, and maintain Japanese gardens and landscapes in Calgary. We consciously follow the principles of the craft while making the necessary adjustments to suit the climate and ecology of our region. Our work is a labor of love, with a deep appreciation of the Japanese aesthetics and the cultural values of simplicity and harmony with nature.</h3></div></div></section><section class="bg-dark-blue"><div class="flex flex-even flex-wrap flex-gap3"><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-69.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-70.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div></div><div class="p-y3 p-x1"><h2 class="d-2 tx-c tx-white">Why Calgarians Should Be Embracing Japanese Zen Dry Gardens in 2024</h2><p class="d-6 tx-c tx-white">By Jose G. Monagas | November 2023 | Calgary, AB Canada</p></div><div class="ctn-1100 m-auto"><div class="m-b-4x"><h3 class="d-6 tx-white">Watering lawns and gardens can be costly and wasteful, especially in a dry climate like Calgary. In contrast, Japanese Zen dry gardens rely on boulders, stones, rocks, gravel, sand, and drought tolerant plants.</h3><p class="d-6 tx-white">According to the City of Calgary, some 30% of all residential water consumption is attributed to the irrigation of lawns and gardens. In 2023, the average water bill for a household was $111 per month. If we consider a reduction of 30% in this monthly expense during the summer months, the potential yearly savings for each household could be around $200. Given the 356,225 families residing in private households in Calgary, as per the 2021 census, these savings are quite substantial. </p><p class="d-6 tx-white">Furthermore, research from the University of Alberta suggests that the inclusion of green spaces can boost property values in Edmonton by 5% to 15%. Applying this 5% increase to the average residential property value in Calgary, which was $555,000 in 2023, it can be inferred that the addition of a Japanese Zen dry garden could potentially enhance the property value per household by $27,750.</p><p class="d-6 tx-white">It is a fact that the Calgary's total budget for Parks and Open Spaces has increased steadily as from 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent. However, building Japanese Zen dry gardens in Calgary will require more planning, designing, and collaboration among homeowners, landscapers, gardeners, architects, engineers, city officials, community groups, and cultural organizations. </p><h3 class="d-6 tx-white">Outstandingly, Japanese Zen dry gardens can contribute to better mental health by providing opportunities for relaxation, which can lead to enjoying a higher quality of life. They also foster a stronger sense of community while promoting spaces for people to engage in social and cultural activities. They allow people of all ages, abilities and social backgrounds to connect with nature in a tranquil oasis. They can support the economic growth of the city by generating jobs and services.</h3><p class="d-6 tx-white">The goal is to ensure that homes, parks, and public spaces remain healthy, beautiful, and functional, as a way to create a more sustainable, attractive, and inclusive Calgary despite the unfolding effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the Russia vs. Ukraine war, housing deficit, property tax increases, the Israel vs. Hamas war, inflation rates, etc.</p><h3 class="d-6 tx-white">By following the example of the City of Lethbridge, which is renowned for its Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden, the City of Calgary could also tap into potential revenue streams such as entrance fees, sales from gift shops, event rentals, and charitable donations.</h3><p class="d-6 tx-white">For example, the Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden reported a total of 43,808 visitors in 2021. Using this figure as a benchmark, a public Japanese style garden in Calgary, with an average entry fee of $12.50, could potentially generate over $500,000 in admission revenue alone. This income, coupled with the annual revenue from the Calgary Stampede events, could contribute to funding more public, community, and cultural diversity initiatives. This is particularly noteworthy considering that the Calgary Stampede attracted approximately 1.38 million attendees, including locals and tourists, in 2023; and reported a revenue of $13 million in 2022.</p><p class="d-6 tx-white">Now, if we apply the same financial principles and logic to local household economies, with an average cost of $50 thousand per residential landscape project, Calgary could be earning a significant increase in tax revenue. Yet, for a more accurate financial analysis, it would be necessary to conduct a detailed feasibility study considering the specific circumstances and market conditions in Calgary.</p><p class="d-6 tx-white"><b>Important Updates</b>: The Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden generated an economic impact of ~$800,000 in 2023. The City of Calgary proposed a 4.4 percent property tax rate increase for 2023.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-soft"><div class="flex flex-even flex-wrap flex-gap3"><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-34.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div><div class="ctn-500"><img class="b-black" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-17.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"></div></div><div class="p-y3 p-x1"><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Creating a Japanese Style Garden on a Budget in Calgary in 2024</h2><p class="d-6 tx-c">By Jose G. Monagas | December 2023 | Calgary, AB Canada</p></div><div class="ctn-1100 m-auto"><div class="m-b-4x"><h3 class="d-6">As the average house price in Calgary is expected to be $564,000 at the end of 2023, a Japanese style landscape can significantly boost your property's value. </h3><p class="d-6">You may need to hire a landscape architect to help you design your Japanese garden, choose the right plants, layout, and structures. The cost for this service can range from $2,000 to $6,000.</p><p class="d-6">Next, you will need a garden design plan to guide the landscaping crews during the construction phase. The cost for this can range from $2,000 to $6,000.</p><p class="d-6">The choice of plants and trees is a crucial aspect of a Japanese garden. Depending on the species and quantity you choose, this could cost you between $5,000 and $30,000.</p><p class="d-6">We recommend you consult with a local nursery or horticultural expert when planning, as Calgary's climate may not be suitable for all species.</p><h3 class="d-6">Your shortlist of plants could include: 10 species of lilacs (for their fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring); 10 species of maples (for their vibrant fall colours); 10 species of bushes (for their hardiness and suitability for gardens in Calgary); 10 species of pines (for their year round greenery); and 10 species of caraganas (for their ability to survive in harsh climates).</h3><p class="d-6">Rocks and gravel are essential elements of Japanese gardens. These could cost you from $2,000 to $6,000.</p><p class="d-6">Adding fixed structures such as stone lanterns, entrance gates, and fences can add to the authenticity of your Japanese garden. These structures could cost between $5,000 and $20,000.</p><p class="d-6">The cost of transporting and delivering materials to your home can range from $2,000 to $6,000.</p><p class="d-6">The labour costs for landscaping crews can vary greatly, depending on the complexity of the design and the size of your garden. These costs could range from $10,000 to $50,000.</p><p class="d-6">Maintaining a Japanese garden might be challenging for you alone. Thus, you may need to budget between $1,000 and $6,000 for yearly maintenance and upkeep. </p><h3 class="d-4">There Are Several Other Factors to Consider When Budgeting for Your Japanese Garden:</h3><p class="d-6">Depending on the scale of your project and local regulations, you may need to obtain City permits. The cost of these permits can vary.</p><p class="d-6">If your garden design includes water features or outdoor lighting, there will be utility costs to consider, unless you use solar powered features.</p><p class="d-6">As some plants may not survive the winter, you may need to budget for replacing plants or providing them with winter protection. Pests can be a problem in any garden, and you may need to budget for pest control measures.</p><p class="d-6">If you are not a gardening expert, you might need to hire a professional for regular maintenance tasks like pruning, shaping, weeding, etc.</p><p class="d-6">Depending on the value of your garden, especially with expensive structures or rare plants, you might want to consider getting them insured.</p><h3 class="d-6">With careful planning and budgeting, you can create a serene and elegant Japanese landscape.

Monagas | January 2024 | Calgary, AB Canada</p></div><div class="ctn-1100 m-auto"><div class="m-b-4x"><h3 class="d-6">For some of us, traditional college schooling or an apprenticeship can be quite formal and expensive. In contrast, self-learning and lifelong learning can be cost-effective, with so many open and affordable resources available, including books, manuals, online tutorials, forums, blogs, and more. The best learning method depends on your personal learning style, availability, and career goals.</h3><p class="d-6">Without the constraints of conventional schooling or an apprenticeship, you have the freedom to explore and experiment. You can learn at your own pace, focusing on those areas that interest you the most. This freedom fosters creativity and innovation, allowing you to develop your unique talents.</p><p class="d-6">This makes Japanese style landscaping accessible to everyone, regardless of race, gender, income, and other circumstances. Without the pressure of grades and attendance, you can tailor your learning schedule according to your lifestyle. Whether you are a working professional, a retiree, or a stay-at-home parent, you can always find time to indulge in your passion for Japanese style landscaping. This also creates an educational environment that celebrates diversity and caters to the needs of every single learner.</p><h3 class="d-6">More importantly, Japanese Zen style landscaping is more than just gardening -- it is a blend of art and self-awareness. You learn to be patient, observant, and mindful. These requirements not only improve your landscaping skills but also contribute to your personal development. Every expert was once a novice. Thus, learning Japanese style landscaping as a self-taught individual can be a very rewarding experience.</h3><p class="d-6">In my case, I highly regard personalized learning and project-based learning. Through them, I can immerse myself on complex, real-world projects that require critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration with others, which allows me to explore topics of interest in greater depth. Naturally, there are times when I need a mentor who can provide me with guidance, inspiration, and practical knowledge.</p><p class="d-6">Also, through hands-on learning, I can apply both my personal and professional experience as an invaluable tool in a field that is continually evolving, where practical skills are as important as theoretical knowledge.</p><h3 class="d-6">As a non-Japanese in Calgary, I know firsthand that understanding the underlying principles of Japanese style landscaping requires time and energy -- and some might find it quite challenging. However, anyone can do well as long as you have a deep respect for the culture, philosophy, and aesthetics while creating spaces that reflect the natural world and bring a sense of peace.</h3><p class="d-6">What is more, in navigating the challenges of self-learning traditional Japanese style landscaping in a foreign country, I have found that although there are numerous books and online resources on Japanese style landscaping, not all of them are comprehensive. In fact, some resources may oversimplify or misinterpret the principles of Japanese style landscaping.</p><p class="d-6">Another factor to consider is that there are not many experts in Japanese style landscaping outside of Japan; thus, some learners may struggle to grasp the intricate details of this art form.</p><p class="d-6">Lastly, I cannot skip highlighting the differences in climate and plant availability between Japan and North America. You must be open to learn and adapt Japanese style landscaping principles to local conditions in Calgary. This involves choosing plant species that are similar to those used in Japanese gardens but are suited to the North American climate. You could also modify traditional techniques to work with the local environment where certain plant species may not thrive.</p><h3 class="d-6">In my experience, self-learning Japanese Zen style landscaping in North America is a feasible and rewarding journey. The key is the ability to learn independently and apply this knowledge creatively. The belief that professional Japanese landscaping requires formal credentials stems from the respect for tradition and mastery. However, this perspective overlooks the potential of self-learning and the value of hands-on experience.</h3></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="bg-black"><section><div class="flex
