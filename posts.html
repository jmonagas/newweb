Monagas, September 2023</p><p class="p-blog">Calgary has very cold winters and hot summers with abundant rain. It is a prairie climate with sunny weather almost all year round. But it is a dry climate &mdash; and some say, it is bone dry. Yet, we are very fortunate because Calgary is the sunniest city in Canada, with an average 2,396 hours, or 333 days, of sunshine yearly; with July being the hottest month with an average temperature of 16.5 degrees Celsius, while January averages minus 7 degrees. The wettest month in Calgary is June, with an average of 80 millimeters of rain. Then again, March is Calgary's snowiest month, with an average of about 23 centimeters of snow.</p><p class="p-blog">In contrast, Japan is a rainy country with lots of humidity. The temperature in Kyoto, for example in the month of May, ranges from 24 degrees Celsius to 13 degrees, with an average precipitation level of 154 millimeters. Indeed, Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate, but winters are comparatively cold with occasional snowfall.</p><p class="p-blog">Landscaping is a seasonal and labor intensive business, with high turnover rates. So, why would you choose to start a Calgary based landscaping company with a focus on traditional Japanese style garden design, construction, and maintenance?</p><p class="p-blog">According to one of the sources consulted while planning our business model, a landscaping project in Calgary ranges from $10 thousand to $100+ thousand. Next, we found that the most profitable landscaping business comes from lawn care and maintenance, followed closely by yard cleaning. On the list of services that add more value to real estate properties are deck construction, sprinkler system installation and maintenance, removal of mature or unwanted trees, landscape lighting installation, etc.</p><h2 class="p-blog h7">Financially speaking, landscaping projects that enlarge living space and require low maintenance while adding beauty to a property rank at the top, and increase a home resale value by 15 percent to 20 percent. For this reason, traditional Japanese style gardening, trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, ponding, etc. adds as much or even more value to your property.</h2><p class="p-blog">Ishidoro Zen Gardens' landscaping services are rooted in Japanese aesthetics with respect to creating a miniature, idealized natural landscape with elements such as water, rocks, plants, stone lanterns, other. We plan to become Calgary's best Japanese style landscaping company despite the challenges in creating gardens in Calgary's unique environment. This has been done with great success in Edmonton and Lethbridge; and there are more than 300 public Japanese gardens in North America.</p><p class="p-blog">Specifically, for a Japanese style garden in Calgary to be viable, we will select those plants and trees that are native to our geographic setting, and can endure the local climate while still providing the appeal of a traditional Japanese style garden and landscape. For example, here in Alberta, for a tranquil space that harmonizes with nature, we have a wide variety of pine trees, shrubs, and ground covering plants that are easy to source at local shops and nurseries. Also, rhododendrons and azaleas have hardy varieties that can last in Calgary. We will provide advice on selecting plants, designing the layout, and maintaining the garden.</p><h2 class="p-blog h7">We see ourselves as the Japanese style landscape artists who can provide Calgarians with authentic Japanese style landscaping services. In line with the common principles that guide the design of a Japanese garden, we bring simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature to every single garden design. We do not intend to replicate existing Japanese gardens in Japan or abroad. Instead, we aim at borrowing the local scenery to astonish our clients and customers. Calgary is our enclosure!</h2><p class="p-blog">For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. Later on, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees. You are free to create and unite the beauty of Japanese landscaping and gardening one step (or project) at a time.
