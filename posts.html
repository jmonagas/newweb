We deeply value the classic elegance of Japanese style gardening and the serenity of Zen dry landscaping, and their benefits.</p></div></div></header><main><section><div class="main-title"><h1 class="m-bot-2">A Dream of Japanese Gardening and Landscaping</h1><p>By Jose G. Monagas &nbsp;||&nbsp; Ishidoro Zen Gardens Inc.</p></div></section><section><div class="row-content"><div class="col-content bg-23"><div class="ctn-small"><p class="m-bot-3 ">In Calgary, the climate gracefully offers a taste of icy serenity and fiery passion. So, you should expect to transition between cold winters and hot summers with plenty of rain. It is prairie-like, and mostly sunny throughout the year. Despite being dry, Calgary is known for being the sunniest city in Canada, with an average of 2,396 hours of sunshine annually.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">More precisely, July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 16.5 degrees Celsius, while January is the coldest at minus 7 degrees. The wettest month is June with an average of 80mm of rain; and March is the snowiest with around 23cm of snow.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">In contrast, Japan is a rainy country with high humidity levels. For example, in May, Kyoto has temperatures ranging from 24 to 13 degrees Celsius, with an average precipitation of 154 millimeters. Although Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate, winters can be cold with some snowfall.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">It is no secret that landscaping is one of the most seasonal and labor-intensive businesses in Canada. It also has one of the highest turnover rates in the industry. So why would you want to start your own Calgary-based landscaping business specializing in Japanese Zen style garden design, construction and maintenance?</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">Well, one of the sources we consulted while developing our business model shared this very interesting piece of information: A landscaping project in Calgary can cost anywhere from $10,000 to over $100,000. The most profitable areas within the landscaping industry are lawncare and maintenance, with yard cleaning following closely behind. Additionally, services like deck construction, sprinkler system installation and maintenance, removal of mature or unwanted trees, and landscape lighting installation are highly sought after as they significantly increase the value of real estate properties. </p><p class="m-bot-3 ">When it comes to finances, landscaping projects that not only increase your living space but also require minimal maintenance rank at the top as a smart investment. These projects not only enhance a home's curb appeal but also have the potential to raise its resale value by 15 to 20 percent. This is why incorporating elements of traditional Japanese style gardening, such as trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, and ponding, can significantly increase the value of your property. </p><p class="m-bot-3 ">At Ishidoro Zen Gardens, we are dedicated to crafting Japanese style landscapes that embody the essence of nature through elements like water, rocks, gravel, plants, and stone lanterns. Despite the unique challenges of Calgary's environment, we aim to be recognized as the Japanese style landscaping company of choice in our city. Remarkably, Edmonton and Lethbridge are a testament to the viability of Japanese style gardening in Alberta; and we found a database with more than 300 public Japanese Gardens in North America to draw some inspiration from.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">Now, when creating a Japanese style garden or landscape in Calgary, we carefully choose plants and trees that are native to our region, and can withstand the local weather conditions, while still embodying the essence of a traditional Japanese style garden. In Alberta, we have a diverse selection of pine trees, shrubs, and ground covering plants that are readily available at nearby stores and nurseries, helping to create a tranquil and natural environment. Additionally, hardy rhododendrons and azaleas are suitable choices for Calgary. We are here to assist with selecting the right plants, designing the layout, and caring for your garden.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">We see ourselves as modern Japanese style landscape artists, committed to providing Calgarians with authentic Japanese style landscaping services. Embracing the core principles that shape the design of a Japanese garden, we infuse simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature into every garden we craft. Our aim is not to replicate existing Japanese gardens in Japan or abroad, but to utilize the local scenery to astonish our valued clients and customers. Calgary is our enclosure.</p><p class="m-bot-3 ">For your next landscaping project, we could begin by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meters) into your property. Later on, we could introduce a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or perhaps some maples, or cherry trees. You have the freedom to combine the beauty of Japanese landscaping and gardening one step (or project) at a time.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about building your dream Japanese style garden and landscape according to your preferences, we recommend checking out: <a class="high-link txt-bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/japanesegardentv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Japanese Garden TV">Japanese Garden TV</a>.
