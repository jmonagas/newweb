So, we have summarized below the 10 most frequently asked questions made by friends, clients and associates, along with our answers. It is by no means final, just a concious exercise to remain transparent. </h3></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-27.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Why are Japanese Zen style gardens timeless?</h2><p>The famous "Garden of Six Attributes" or "Kenrokuen" was created in the 1620s, and is considered the oldest Japanese garden in the entire world. Next, we have the "Plum Blossom Garden" or "Koishikawa Korakuen", an exquisite traditional Japanese garden completed in 1669. These are just two references to prove the point that timelessness is a key characteristic of Japanese landscaping.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-26.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">What are the features of Japanese Zen style gardens?</h2><p>Contrary to what we may find on the web nowadays, traditional elements in a Japanese garden include waterfalls, sand, gravel, stones, rocks, islands, hills, bridges, streams, fish, paths, stone lanterns, bamboo, moss, ponds, trees, fences, gates, basins, other. It all depends on the type of garden chosen by the creator. Moreover, they may be styled as rock or dry gardens, hill and pond gardens, tea gardens, and stroll gardens.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-29.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">How can you bring nature indoors with Japanese Zen style gardens? </h2><p>It is true that contemporary homes do not have great outdoors as land is a highly priced commodity. Yet, you can have a small Japanese garden in an interior courtyard or balcony. Traditionally these tiny gardens are meant to be seen, not entered, with the features of gardens in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. In fact, you can have a Japanese garden in a small box right in your bedroom or office.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-24.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Where can you learn more about Japanese Zen style gardens?</h2><p>We can say that Japanese gardens began in the 7th century and are still evolving. You could start by reading books and websites with useful information about their design, history and periods. Additionally, you could take a trip to Kyoto or Tokyo, or visit the Japanese gardens in North America. The choice will always be yours. Just keep in mind that there is no perfect garden. In essence, they all are perfect.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-44.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Why should you consider having your own Japanese Zen style gardens? </h2><p>The main reason for this is the personal transformation you can experience while planning and creating your own space, finding features you like and incorporating them as you go, followed by the realization of its daily or monthly or yearly maintenance, just for enjoyment and relaxation. Your Japanese garden is your special place where peace and serenity meet your most basic needs for self expression.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-63.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Where in North America can you find Japanese Zen style gardens? </h2><p>For those of us with a limited budget and plenty of family responsibilities, here in Canada, we have: Nitobe Memorial Garden in Vancouver, BC; the University of Alberta Botanic Garden in Edmonton, AB; Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden in Lethbridge, AB; the Japanese Garden and Pavilion in Montreal, QC; and Kariya Park in Mississauga, ON.

So, you may ask again: Is it the pruning of the trees and shrubs, or the raking of the white gravel, or the shape of koi ponds, or the wooden gates, or the bamboo fences, or the stone lanterns, or the type of moss, or any other thing that make a Japanese garden so especial? You will have to experience it first-hand in order to make sense of what we are saying here.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-66.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">How can you create a Japanese Zen style garden you can be proud of? </h2><p>Regardless of what you may find on the web, Japanese gardens have no religious motive nowadays. Instead, they attempt to imitate scenic beauty in miniature or reinterpret a garden from literary texts. The key attributes include spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, waterways, and panorama. The historical periods in Japan influenced garden design and mirrored society.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-68.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Why would you make your dreamed Japanese Zen style gardens a reality? </h2><p>It might be for personal realization or just for fun. But every person has a different drive to accomplish their goals. It has nothing to do with how much wealth one might have or wish to own. Ignore those ads or lousy videos about what you will get with a Japanese garden and landscape, and ask yourself: What does this mean to me personally? Why would I do this? The answer will always be the right one.</p></div></div><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/640-47.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">How much should you spend to have a great Japanese and Zen style garden?</h2><p>We cannot ask you to spend $50,000 or $100,000 or $150,000 in building a Japanese Zen style garden and landscape at your real estate property when your current affairs demand more attention and care. You can start building your Japanese garden with only $1,000. They can be designed to create a peaceful environment for those suffering from anxiety or stress.</p></div></div></section><section><div class="pad-bt"><div class="pad-bt"><h2 class="txt-center txt-h1 bold ">Contact Us Today For A Free Consultation</h2><h3 class="txt-center txt-h7 p-round">Get a Free Estimate!
