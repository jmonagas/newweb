In fact, the need for areas of peace and quiet within our city and urban homes grows exponentially every year. Japanese style landscaping and Zen gardens, with their minimalist yet profound design, offer a respite from the chaos of everyday life. They serve as a reminder of the beauty and serenity that nature offers, promoting mindfulness and relaxation. Ishidoro Zen Gardens understands this intrinsic value of Zen gardens. We believe in their power to transform spaces and lives.</h3><h4 class="h7 p-all">By incorporating rocks, water features, moss, pruned trees, bushes, and raked gravel or sand, we create landscapes that are pleasing with a sense of calm. Each garden created is a reflection of the Zen principles of simplicity, naturalness, and austerity. We have transformed dull spaces into Japanese Zen style gardens, each unique yet echoing the same principles of harmony and balance. Our work is a testament to our commitment to bringing the serenity of Zen to Calgary, adding a chapter to its rich history.</h4></div><div class="halves p-all bg-white"><h2>Quality and Protection</h2><h3 class="h7 p-all">In order to guarantee that you get top quality and protection, Ishidoro Zen Gardens is fully committed, licenced, insured, and bonded. For a Japanese style garden to be viable in Calgary, we will select those plants and trees that are native to our geographic setting, and can endure the local climate while still providing the appeal of a traditional Japanese style garden and landscape. As a non-Japanese in Calgary, the founder knows first-hand that understanding the underlying principles of Japanese style landscaping requires time and energy, but it is both rewarding and uplifting.</h3><h4 class="h7 p-all">To give you an example, here in Alberta, for a tranquil space that harmonizes with nature, we have a wide variety of pine trees, shrubs, and ground covering plants that are easy to source at local shops and nurseries. Also, rhododendrons and azaleas have hardy varieties that can last in Calgary. We will provide you with the basic advice on selecting plants, designing the layout, and maintaining the garden.

Its beauty is present in spaces such as a small yard, a balcony, an office box, or a window box. There are no hard rules: You are free to create and unite the beauty of Japanese style landscaping and gardening one step (or project) at a time. This makes Japanese style landscaping accessible to everyone, regardless of race, gender, income, and other circumstances.</p><p class="p-all">Evidently, the simplicity of dry Zen gardens contrasts the abundance of plants in stroll gardens. Zen gardens are based on seven principles: Austerity, Simplicity, Naturalness, Asymmetry, Subtlety, Magical, and Stillness. The five principles of Japanese style gardens are: Asymmetry, Enclosure, Borrowed Scenery, Balance, and Symbolism. With a keen eye for Japanese style aesthetics and a deep respect of the principles of Zen, we transform ordinary spaces into striking and elegant landscapes that echo the harmony and balance of nature. We bring simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature to every single garden design.</p><h3 class="h7 p-all">You have the freedom to explore and experiment. For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. After that, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees. Contact us now for a free consultation &mdash; no strings attached or credit card required. Ishidoro Zen Gardens is a modern landscaping company that can transform your spaces into magnificent landscapes, without breaking the bank, on a journey to a stress free environment.</h3></div></div></section></main><footer class="p-xtr bg-forest"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Home</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="services.html" title="Go to Services"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Services</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Contact</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Terms</li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="news.html" title="Go to News"><li class="tx-center foot-links">News</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Themes</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Questions</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Posts</li></a></ul></div></div><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="Connect LinkedIn" title="Connect LinkedIn" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Connect Facebook" title="Connect Facebook" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Connect Twitter" title="Connect Twitter" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Connect Instagram" title="Connect Instagram" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Connect Blogger" title="Connect Blogger" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Connect Pinterest" title="Connect Pinterest" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div></div></div><div class="p-all"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &copy; <span id="copyYear" class="tx-white"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script><script type="application/ld+json">{ "@context": "https://schema.org", "@ype": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ishidoro Zen Gardens", "image": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/img/bookmark.jpg", "@id": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "url": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "telephone": "403-397-3696", "priceRange": "$$$", "address":{ "@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "10 Ave SW", "addressLocality": "Calgary", "addressRegion": "AB", "postalCode": "T2R0B6", "addressCountry": "CA"}, "openingHoursSpecification":{ "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" ], "opens": "08:30", "closes": "17:30"}, "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/", "https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen", "https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/", "https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens", "https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/", "https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/", "https://www.youtube.com/@IshidoroZenGardensInc" ]} </script></body></html>
