With a keen eye for Japanese style aesthetics and a deep respect of the principles of Zen, we transform ordinary spaces into striking and elegant landscapes that echo the harmony and balance of nature.</p><p class="tx-pad">In accordance with the common principles that guide the design of a traditional Japanese style garden, we bring simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature to every single garden design. We see ourselves as the Japanese style landscaping artists who can provide Calgarians with authentic Japanese and Zen style landscaping services.

It is believed that these elements together make unique gardens. Broadly, stone lanterns are carved in a variety of shapes, sizes and styles. In fact, Japanese stone lanterns are not meant to provide functional lighting at night. Rather, they do not alter the ambience of the night. Nevertheless, a Japanese lantern can be made of stone, wood, metal, concrete, plastic, resin, ceramic, or paper. In Japanese style gardening, stones are essential for a balanced landscape.</p><p class="tx-pad">A real estate property, whether new or longstanding, that is well designed, built, and maintained, will increase its value by incorporating the beauty of Japanese Zen style gardens and landscapes, not just by planting flowers or mowing the lawns. For this reason, traditional Japanese style gardening, trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, ponding, etc. adds as much or even more value to your property. Ishidoro Zen Gardens is to become the number one choice for real estate owners, property managers and government agencies when it comes to Japanese Zen style gardens and landscapes.</p></div><div class="flex-cont"><img class="highs" loading="lazy" src="./img/171-min.jpeg" width="683px" height="512px" alt="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" title="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" /></div></div></section><section class="bg-white"><div class="flex-halves"><div class="flex-cont"><img class="highs" loading="lazy" src="./img/118-min.jpeg" width="683px" height="512px" alt="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" title="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" /></div><div class="flex-cont"><h2 class="tx-left p-subs">What Type of Japanese Garden Should Your Special Space Be?</h2><p class="tx-pad">In Japan, gardens evolved based on the common belief that forests, mountains, and the sea were home to nature spirits, and included elements such as ponds, streams, waterfalls, rocks, and vegetation. Thus, they were originally created for ceremonies honoring spirits believed to have come from heaven, or from across the sea. Later on, they became a play area for the privileged, and a vehicle for something more profound for monks and warriors as well. Evidently, the simplicity of dry Zen gardens contrasts the abundance of plants in stroll gardens. Zen gardens are based on seven principles: Austerity, Simplicity, Naturalness, Asymmetry, Subtlety, Magical, and Stillness. The five principles of Japanese style gardens are: Asymmetry, Enclosure, Borrowed Scenery, Balance, and Symbolism. The choice is yours to make!</p><p class="tx-pad">You have the freedom to explore and experiment. For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. After that, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees. </p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white"><div class="flex-halves"><div class="flex-cont"><h2 class="tx-left p-subs">Our Warranty, Your Protection</h2><p class="tx-pad">In order to guarantee that you get top quality and protection, Ishidoro Zen Gardens is fully committed, licenced, insured, and bonded.
