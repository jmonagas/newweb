It is believed that these elements together make unique gardens.</p><p>Broadly, stone lanterns are carved in a variety of shapes, sizes and styles. In fact, Japanese stone lanterns are not meant to provide functional lighting at night. Rather, they do not alter the ambience of the night. Nevertheless, a Japanese lantern can be made of stone, wood, metal, concrete, plastic, resin, ceramic, or paper.</p><p>In Japanese style gardening, stones are essential for a balanced landscape. A real estate property, whether new or longstanding, that is well designed, built, and maintained, will increase its value by incorporating the beauty of Japanese Zen style gardens and landscapes, not just by planting flowers or mowing the lawns. For this reason, traditional Japanese style gardening, trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, ponding, etc. adds as much or even more value to your property. Ishidoro Zen Gardens is to become the number one choice for real estate owners, property managers and government agencies when it comes to Japanese Zen style gardens and landscapes.</p></div></section><section><div class="blog img-c"><img loading="lazy" class="float-r img-c" src="./img/640-38.jpg" width="600px" height="400px" alt="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" title="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping"><h2 class="txt-left">What Type of Japanese Garden Should Your Special Space Be?</h2><p>In Japan, gardens evolved based on the common belief that forests, mountains, and the sea were home to nature spirits, and included elements such as ponds, streams, waterfalls, rocks, and vegetation. Thus, they were originally created for ceremonies honoring spirits believed to have come from heaven, or from across the sea. Later on, they became a play area for the privileged, and a vehicle for something more profound for monks and warriors as well. Evidently, the simplicity of dry Zen gardens contrasts the abundance of plants in stroll gardens.</p><p>Zen gardens are based on seven principles: Austerity, Simplicity, Naturalness, Asymmetry, Subtlety, Magical, and Stillness. The five principles of Japanese style gardens are: Asymmetry, Enclosure, Borrowed Scenery, Balance, and Symbolism. The choice is yours to make! You have the freedom to explore and experiment. For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. After that, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees. </p></div></section><section><div class="blog"><img loading="lazy" class="float-l img-c" src="./img/640-32.jpg" width="600px" height="400px" alt="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping" title="Japanese Zen Style Gardening and Landscaping"><h2 class="txt-left">Our Warranty, Your Protection</h2><p>In order to guarantee that you get top quality and protection, Ishidoro Zen Gardens is fully committed, licenced, insured, and bonded. </p><p>For a Japanese style garden to be viable in Calgary, we will select those plants and trees that are native to our geographic setting, and can endure the local climate while still providing the appeal of a traditional Japanese style garden and landscape.</p><p>As a non-Japanese in Calgary, the founder knows firsthand that understanding the underlying principles of Japanese style landscaping requires time and energy, but it is both rewarding and uplifting.</p><p>For example, here in Alberta, for a tranquil space that harmonizes with nature, we have a wide variety of pine trees, shrubs, and ground covering plants that are easy to source at local shops and nurseries.
