Rock gardens (also known as Zen gardens) were first created at Zen Buddhism temples (1336-1573) to imitate the intimate essence of nature and serve as an aid to meditation about the true meaning of existence. With a keen eye for Japanese aesthetics and a deep understanding of the principles of Zen, we transform spaces into striking and elegant landscapes that echo the harmony and balance of nature. We see ourselves as the Japanese landscape artists who can provide Calgarians with authentic Japanese and Zen styled landscaping services. In accordance with the common principles that guide the design of a Japanese garden, we bring simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and nature to every single garden design. We do not intend to replicate existing gardens in Japan or abroad. Instead, we aim at borrowing the local scenery to astonish our clients and customers.</p></div></header><main><article><section><div><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Focus on Low Maintenance and Sustainable Gardens</h2><img class="flex-col-50-img f-left p-round" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-10.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"><p class="d-6">The importance of low maintenance and sustainable gardens for Calgarians cannot be overstated. In fact, the need for areas of peace and quiet within our city and urban homes grows exponentially every year. Japanese style landscaping and Zen gardens, with their minimalist yet profound design, offer a respite from the chaos of everyday life. They serve as a reminder of the beauty and serenity that nature offers, promoting mindfulness and relaxation. Ishidoro Zen Gardens understands this intrinsic value of Zen gardens. We believe in their power to transform spaces and lives. By incorporating rocks, water features, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and raked gravel or sand, we create landscapes that are pleasing with a sense of calm. Each garden we create is a reflection of the Zen principles of simplicity, naturalness, and austerity. We have transformed disappointing spaces into Japanese Zen gardens, each unique yet echoing the same principles of harmony and balance. With passion and dedication, our work is a testament to our commitment to bringing the serenity of Zen to the heart of Calgary, adding a new chapter to its rich history.</p></div></section><section><div><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Not Just Another Landscaping Company Out There</h2><img class="flex-col-50-img f-right p-round" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-23.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"><p class="d-6">Ishidoro Zen Gardens is not just another landscaping company out there, but a purveyor of serenity.

Firstly, the founder recognized the therapeutic benefits of Japanese style gardens in a world increasingly dominated by technology and fast paced lifestyles. Secondly, he was inspired by the aesthetic appeal of Zen dry gardens. With their minimalist design and natural elements, Zen dry gardens are a visual treat, offering a stark contrast to the "concrete jungles of urban landscapes covered by unsustainable lawns". The journey from inception to the present day has been an exciting path of steady growth and learning for us. Starting with a crew of two passionate landscapers, the company has plans to continue to grow, to include a diverse team of experts in the field of Zen dry landscaping. Over the years, we have honed our skills and deepened our understanding of the principles of Japanese gardening and landscaping along with a deep respect of Zen philosophy. This solid ground enables us to create gardens that are unique and striking. </p></div></section><section><div><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Japanese Zen Gardens Have a Beauty of Their Own</h2><img class="flex-col-50-img f-right p-round" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-19.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"><p class="d-6">Creating a Japanese or Zen styled garden and landscape requires both time, effort and skills.

It is believed that these elements together make unique gardens. Broadly, stone lanterns are carved in a variety of shapes, sizes and styles. In fact, Japanese stone lanterns are not meant to provide functional lighting at night. Rather, they do not alter the ambience of the night. Nevertheless, a Japanese lantern can be made of stone, wood, metal, concrete, plastic, resin, ceramic, or paper. In Japanese gardening, stones are essential for a balanced landscape. A real estate property, whether new or longstanding, that is well designed, built, and maintained, will increase its value by incorporating the beauty of Japanese Zen styled gardens and landscapes, not just by planting flowers or mowing the lawns. For this reason, traditional Japanese style gardening, trimming, hedging, pruning, planting, gravelling, ponding, etc. adds as much or even more value to your property. Ishidoro Zen Gardens is to become the number one choice for real estate owners, property managers and government agencies when it comes to Japanese Zen styled gardens and landscapes.</p></div></section><section><div><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">What Type of Japanese Garden Should Your Special Space Be?</h2><img class="flex-col-50-img f-left p-round" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-38.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"><p class="d-6">In Japan, gardens evolved based on the common belief that forests, mountains, and the sea were home to nature spirits, and included elements such as ponds, streams, waterfalls, rocks, and vegetation. Thus, they were originally created for ceremonies honoring spirits believed to have come from heaven, or from across the sea. Later on, they became a play area for the privileged, and a vehicle for something more profound for monks and warriors as well. Evidently, the simplicity of dry Zen gardens contrasts the abundance of plants in stroll gardens. The choice is yours to make! For example, for your next landscaping contract, we can start by incorporating a tsuboniwa (approximately 3.3 square meter garden) to your home. After that, we could add a karesansui (dry rock, or Zen garden), or maples, or cherry trees.</p></div></section><section class="bg-black"><div class="flex flex-even flex-wrap flex-gap3"><div class="ctn-350 b-white b-r5 p-y1"><h2 class="d-3 tx-c tx-white">If You Have<br />A Project Already</h2><h3 class="d-6 tx-c tx-white font-w">Learn about plans,<br />budget, and schedule</h3><p class="m-y1 tx-c b-gray bg-white b-r5 m-x1"><a class="d-6 font-w tx-black" href="contact.html#contact-details" target="_blank" title="Book Appointment">Book Appointment </a></p></div><div class="ctn-350 b-white b-r5 p-y1"><h2 class="d-3 tx-c tx-white">If You Have<br />No Project Yet</h2><h3 class="d-6 tx-c tx-white font-w">Learn about options,<br />cost, price, and value </h3><p class="m-y1 tx-c b-gray bg-white b-r5 m-x1"><a class="d-6 font-w tx-black" href="contact.html#contact-details" target="_blank" title="Make Questions">Make Questions </a></p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 class="d-2 tx-c">Our Warranty, Your Protection</h2><img class="flex-col-50-img f-right p-round" loading="lazy" width="640px" height="420px" src="./imgs/640-32.jpg" alt="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Gardens and Landscapes"><p class="d-6">In order to guarantee that you get top quality and protection, Ishidoro Zen Gardens is fully committed, licenced, insured, bonded.
