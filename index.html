tiny yard or balcony to an office cubicle or window box) using a variety of elements like water,
sand, gravel, stones, hills, bridges, streams, fish, paths, stone lanterns, moss, ponds, statues,
gates, basins, trees, bamboo, and fences. This style follows no rigid rules, giving you the freedom
to unite the components in a gradual, evolving process that makes its aesthetic accessible to all,
regardless of race, gender, income, or other circumstances.
</p><h3>The minimalism of Zen stands in contrast to the greenery of stroll gardens</h3><p>Zen gardens adhere to principles of austerity, simplicity, naturalness, asymmetry, subtlety, magic,
and stillness. Japanese gardens embody asymmetry, enclosure, borrowed scenery, balance, and
symbolism. With an appreciation for Japanese aesthetics and respect for Zen concepts, we transform
mundane spaces into refined, harmonious landscapes evoking nature's equilibrium. Our designs infuse
any garden with simplicity, elegance, tranquility, and natural splendor.
</p><h3>You have the freedom to explore and experiment with your new landscape</h3><p>For your next landscaping project, we can start small by incorporating a 3.3 square meter
"tsuboniwa" or Japanese courtyard garden. From there, we can expand with additions like a
"karesansui" dry rock garden, maples, or cherry trees. As a modern landscaping company, Ishidoro
Zen Gardens Inc. can transform your home into a magnificent, budget-friendly landscape that
cultivates a serene, peaceful environment. For more inspiration, please visit our exclusive
