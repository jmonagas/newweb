Monagas, January 2023</p><p class="p-all">For some of us, traditional college schooling or an apprenticeship can be quite formal and expensive. In contrast, self-learning and lifelong learning can be cost-effective, with so many open and affordable resources available, including books, manuals, online tutorials, forums, blogs, and more. The best learning method depends on your personal learning style, availability, and career goals.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">Without the constraints of conventional schooling or an apprenticeship, you have the freedom to explore and experiment. You can learn at your own pace, focusing on those areas that interest you the most. This freedom fosters creativity and innovation, allowing you to develop your unique talents.</h2><p class="p-all">This makes Japanese style landscaping accessible to everyone, regardless of race, gender, income, and other circumstances. Without the pressure of grades and attendance, you can tailor your learning schedule according to your lifestyle. Whether you are a working professional, a retiree, or a stay-at-home parent, you can always find time to indulge in your passion for Japanese style landscaping. This also creates an educational environment that celebrates diversity and caters to the needs of every single learner.</p><p class="p-all">More importantly, Japanese Zen style landscaping is more than just gardening &mdash; it is a blend of art and self-awareness. You learn to be patient, observant, and mindful. These requirements not only improve your landscaping skills but also contribute to your personal development. Every expert was once a novice. Thus, learning Japanese style landscaping as a self-taught individual can be a very rewarding experience.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">In my case, I highly regard personalized learning and project-based learning. Through them, I can immerse myself on complex, real-world projects that require critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration with others, which allows me to explore topics of interest in greater depth. Naturally, there are times when I need a mentor who can provide me with guidance, inspiration, and practical knowledge.</h2><p class="p-all">Also, through hands-on learning, I can apply both my personal and professional experience as an invaluable tool in a field that is continually evolving, where practical skills are as important as theoretical knowledge.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">As a non-Japanese in Calgary, I know firsthand that understanding the underlying principles of Japanese style landscaping requires time and energy &mdash; and some might find it quite challenging. However, anyone can do well as long as you have a deep respect for the culture, philosophy, and aesthetics while creating spaces that reflect the natural world and bring a sense of peace. </h2><p class="p-all">What is more, in navigating the challenges of self-learning traditional Japanese style landscaping in a foreign country, I have found that although there are numerous books and online resources on Japanese style landscaping, not all of them are comprehensive. In fact, some resources may oversimplify or misinterpret the principles of Japanese style landscaping. Another factor to consider is that there are not many experts in Japanese style landscaping outside of Japan; thus, some learners may struggle to grasp the intricate details of this art form.</p><p class="p-all">Lastly, I cannot skip highlighting the differences in climate and plant availability between Japan and North America. You must be open to learn and adapt Japanese style landscaping principles to local conditions in Calgary. This involves choosing plant species that are similar to those used in Japanese gardens but are suited to the North American climate. You could also modify traditional techniques to work with the local environment where certain plant species may not thrive.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">In my experience, self-learning Japanese Zen style landscaping in North America is a feasible and rewarding journey. The key is the ability to learn independently and apply this knowledge creatively. The belief that professional Japanese landscaping requires formal credentials stems from the respect for tradition and mastery. However, this perspective overlooks the potential of self-learning and the value of hands-on experience.</h2></div></div></section><section class="sections bg-creamy"><div class="p-xtr"><div class="flex-box flex-evn gap-3 flex-wrap flex-grow"><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/loyalty-program.jpg" alt="Loyalty Reward Program" title="Loyalty Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/referral-program.jpg" alt="Referral Reward Program" title="Referral Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="p-xtr bg-forest"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Home</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="services.html" title="Go to Services"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Services</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Contact</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Terms</li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="news.html" title="Go to News"><li class="tx-center foot-links">News</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Themes</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Questions</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Posts</li></a></ul></div></div><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="Connect LinkedIn" title="Connect LinkedIn" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Connect Facebook" title="Connect Facebook" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Connect Twitter" title="Connect Twitter" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Connect Instagram" title="Connect Instagram" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Connect Blogger" title="Connect Blogger" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Connect Pinterest" title="Connect Pinterest" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div></div></div><div class="p-all"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &copy; <span id="copyYear" class="tx-white"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script><script type="application/ld+json">{ "@context": "https://schema.org", "@ype": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ishidoro Zen Gardens", "image": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/img/bookmark.jpg", "@id": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "url": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "telephone": "403-397-3696", "priceRange": "$$$", "address":{ "@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "10 Ave SW", "addressLocality": "Calgary", "addressRegion": "AB", "postalCode": "T2R0B6", "addressCountry": "CA"}, "openingHoursSpecification":{ "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" ], "opens": "08:30", "closes": "17:30"}, "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/", "https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen", "https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/", "https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens", "https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/", "https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/", "https://www.youtube.com/@IshidoroZenGardensInc" ]} </script></body></html>
