incremental work of the elements that adds up to a substantial physical and psychological change over
time.Although incorporation took place in Calgary in June 2023, our roots go a long way back to the
1980s. The founder's father started and managed a small construction company in Puerto La Cruz (State of
Anzoategui) Venezuela. Passion and dedication run in the family. So, the founder relocated to Calgary
in the 2000s to build his own world class construction and consulting company, with an aim at providing
professional services in whatever combination is required to meet our clients' needs.</p><p class="tx-pad">One of the top selling points of this type of landscaping style is the fact that a dry
garden requires less care and attention than a traditional lawn; which is just perfect for those
homeowners who have limited time and a budget for their upkeeping. This can transform any space into a
peaceful retreat within their own homes. Our customers are real estate owners who value aesthetics,
tranquility, and sustainability in their outdoor spaces. They usually are busy professionals who want
a low maintenance garden, retirees who enjoy gardening as a hobby, or families who want a safe and fun
place.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white"><div class="flex-halves"><div class="flex-cont"><h2 class="tx-left p-subs">Have a Japanese or Zen Style Garden for Every Season</h2><p class="tx-pad">Contemporary homes do not have great outdoors as land is a highly priced commodity.
Fortunately, Japanese style gardens and landscapes do not require a lot of outdoor space in order to
convey beauty and harmony. These tiny gardens are meant to be seen, not entered, with the features of
gardens in miniature, designed to create tranquility and inspiration. They are beautiful in all weather
or season, and can be any size. </p><p class="tx-pad">As a matter of fact, they are meant to change with and reflect the four seasons. Truly,
you can have a Japanese style garden in a small box right in your bedroom or office. Outstandingly,
Japanese Zen dry gardens can contribute to better mental health by providing opportunities for
relaxation, which can lead to enjoying a higher quality of life. Contact us for a free consultation
&ndash; our services are priced separately, and in some instances, they may be priced together into one
monthly service bill or package.</p></div><div class="flex-cont"><img class="highs" loading="lazy" src="./img/147-min.jpeg" width="683px"

basic needs for self expression. Either small or large, for strolling or just for contemplation,
Japanese and Zen style gardens evoke these feelings. Check out our list with <a href="themes.html"
title="Suggested Landscaping Themes">Suggested Landscaping Themes</a>. According to Shintoism and
Buddhism principles, there is not a perfect Japanese garden. Rather, all of them are perfect in essence!
So, choose quality over quantity.</p><p class="tx-pad">Regardless of what you may find on the web nowadays, Japanese and Zen style gardens or
landscapes have no religious motive. They might be for personal realization or just for fun. But every
person has a different drive to accomplish their goals. It has nothing to do with how much wealth one
might have or wish to own. Ignore those lousy ads or videos about what you will get with a Japanese
style garden, and ask yourself: What does this mean to me personally?</p></div><div class="flex-cont"><img class="highs" loading="lazy" src="./img/152-min.jpeg" width="683px"
