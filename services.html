Whether you are a working professional, a retiree, or a stay-at-home parent, you can always find time to indulge in your passion for Japanese style landscaping. </h3><p class="tx-just p-all">In prior years, both the news and the media have consistently reported that a typical household with a lawn consumes in excess of ten thousand gallons of water per year (a phenomenon known as "the hidden water waste in lawn maintenance"). More interestingly is the fact that in dry climates like Calgary, especially during the hot summer months, many homeowners water their lawns more than necessary in an effort to maintaining their "green" appearance.</p><h4 class="h7 tx-just p-all">Given that a dry garden is a landscape that is specifically created with drought tolerant plants that can survive with little to no irrigation, they are the perfect solution to "the water footprint of lawns in North America". Therefore, it is only rational to note that the adoption of dry gardens is nothing but one smart step towards a more sustainable future.</h4></div></div></section></main><footer class="p-xtr bg-forest"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage">Home</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="services.html" title="Go to Services">Services</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact">Contact</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms">Terms</a></li></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="news.html" title="Go to News">News</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes">Themes</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions">Questions</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts">Posts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="Connect LinkedIn" title="Connect LinkedIn" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Connect Facebook" title="Connect Facebook" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Connect Twitter" title="Connect Twitter" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Connect Instagram" title="Connect Instagram" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Connect Blogger" title="Connect Blogger" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Connect Pinterest" title="Connect Pinterest" width="26px" height="26px"></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="p-all"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &copy; <span id="copyYear" class="tx-white"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Service","@id":"https://ishidorozengardens.com/","additionalType":"https://ishidorozengardens.com/services","alternateName":"Get Quality Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services in Calgary","areaServed":"Calgary, Alberta, Canada","category":"https://ishidorozengardens.com/services","description":"You Don't Need a Lawn.
