well-being of all residents in Calgary
and Alberta, and the strength of our economy. According to the City of Calgary, some 30% of all
residential water consumption is
attributed to the irrigation of lawns and gardens. Fortunately, Calgarians are highly aware of the costs
and benefits of following the
City's YardSmart:
<a href="https://www.calgary.ca/water/programs/yard-smart-water-wise-plants.html"
title="Yard and Garden Plans" target="_blank">Yard
and Garden Plans</a>&nbsp;versus the mandatory outdoor water restrictions. For some, Zen dry gardens
look
simple and rather
monochromatic. But, undoubtedly, this apparent simplicity can be quite deceptive; thus comparable to an
iceberg, where much of the
substance lies beneath the surface.
</p><p class="tx-pad">And here is why: The minimalist design of Zen dry gardens causes the
observer to go deep within
themselves, while reflecting upon the essence of nature and the universe. The gravel, rocks, boulders,
stones, shrubs and moss are
just the canvas for exploring these philosophical concepts. So, when creating your Zen dry garden, take
your time to explore different
designs and choose the elements that resonate with you the
most. You can hire our professional services either as a bundle or individually. Focus on creating a
special space that will promote your peace and tranquility. Each garden presents its own unique
challenges and rewards. Luckily, there
are no strict rules to follow.

initial concept phase to the long term management of operations and maintenance. Our expertise allows us
to turn ideas and designs into reality through world class procurement, financing, legal and local
land-use planning, eco-friendly construction practices, technologies, and resources. Our landscaping
services are rooted in Japanese style aesthetics with respect to creating a miniature, idealized natural
landscape with
water, rocks, plants, stone lanterns, other. Traditionally, in Japan, much of this craftsmanship is
gained through apprenticeship and years of practice to master the specific skills, knowledge, techniques
and philosophies.</p><p class="tx-pad">However, without the constraints of conventional schooling or an apprenticeship, you
have the freedom to explore and experiment. You can learn at your own pace, focusing on those areas that
interest you the most. This freedom fosters creativity and innovation, allowing you to develop your
unique talents.</p></div></div></section><section class="bg-white"><div class="flex-halves"><div class="flex-cont"><h2 class="tx-left p-subs">Versatile and Low Maintenance Landscaping Solutions</h2><p class="tx-pad">In prior years, both the news and the media have consistently reported that a typical
household with a lawn consumes in excess of ten thousand gallons of water per year (a phenomenon known
as "the hidden water waste in lawn maintenance"). More interestingly is the fact that in dry climates
like Calgary, especially during the hot summer months, many homeowners water their lawns more than
necessary in an effort to maintaining their "green" appearance.</p><p class="tx-pad">Therefore, it is only rational to note that the adoption of dry gardens is nothing but
one smart step towards a more sustainable future. Whether you are a working professional, a retiree, or
a stay-at-home parent, you can always find time to indulge in your passion for Japanese style
landscaping. This natural environment celebrates diversity and caters to the needs of every single
individual.</p></div><div class="flex-cont"><img class="highs" loading="lazy" src="./img/133-min.jpeg" width="683px" height="512px"
