well-being of all residents in Calgary and Alberta, and the strength of our economy. According to the City of Calgary, some 30% of all residential water consumption is attributed to the irrigation of lawns and gardens. Fortunately, Calgarians are highly aware of the costs and benefits of following the City's
YardSmart: <a class="txt-3" href="https://www.calgary.ca/water/programs/yard-smart-water-wise-plants.html" title="Yard and Garden Plans" target="_blank">Yard and Garden Plans</a> versus the mandatory outdoor water restrictions.</p><p>For some, Zen dry gardens look simple and rather monochromatic. But, undoubtedly,
this apparent simplicity can be quite deceptive; thus comparable to an iceberg, where much of the substance lies beneath the surface. And here is why: The minimalist design of Zen dry gardens causes the observer to go deep within themselves, while reflecting upon the essence of nature and the universe. The gravel, rocks,
boulders, stones, shrubs and moss are just the canvas for exploring these philosophical concepts.
</p><p>So, when creating your Zen dry garden, take your time to explore different designs
and choose the
elements that resonate with you the
most. You can hire our professional services either as a bundle or individually.
Focus on creating
a special space that will promote your
peace and tranquility. Each garden presents its own unique challenges and rewards.
Luckily, there
are no strict rules to follow.</p></div></section><section><div class="flex2"><div class="svcs"><img src="./img/400-1.jpg" alt="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" title="Japanese Zen Dry Landscaping Services" width="400px" height="250px"></div><div class="desc"><h2 class="txt-left">Design</h2><p>Our team will design the blueprints and complete layout for your gardens and

reality through
world class procurement, financing,
legal and local land-use planning, eco-friendly construction practices, technologies,
and
resources.</p><p>Our landscaping services are rooted in Japanese style aesthetics with respect to
creating a
miniature, idealized natural landscape with
water, rocks, plants, stone lanterns, other. Traditionally, in Japan, much of this
craftsmanship is
gained through apprenticeship and
years of practice to master the specific skills, knowledge, techniques and
philosophies.</p><p>However, without the constraints of conventional schooling or an apprenticeship, you
have the
freedom to explore and experiment. You can
learn at your own pace, focusing on those areas that interest you the most. This
freedom fosters

typical household
with a lawn consumes in excess of ten
thousand gallons of water per year (a phenomenon known as "the hidden water waste
in lawn
maintenance").</p><p>More interestingly is the fact that in dry climates like Calgary, especially
during the hot summer
months, many homeowners water their
lawns more than necessary in an effort to maintaining their "green" appearance.</p><p>Therefore, it is only rational to note that the adoption of dry gardens is nothing
but one smart
step towards a more sustainable future.
</p><p>Whether you are a working professional, a retiree, or a stay-at-home parent, you
can always find
time to indulge in your passion for
Japanese style landscaping. This natural environment celebrates diversity and
caters to the needs
of every single individual.</p></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="foot"><div class="flex1"><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage">About</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="services.html" title="Go to Services">Services</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact">Contact</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms">Terms</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes">Themes</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions">Questions</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="news.html" title="Go to News">News</a></div><div class="foot-links txt-center"><a href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts">Posts</a></div></div><div class="pad-tb"><div class="flex1 bgd-2"><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Facebook" title="Facebook" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Twitter" title="Twitter" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Instagram" title="Instagram" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Blogger" title="Blogger" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div><div class="foot-social txt-center"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Pinterest" title="Pinterest" height="30px" width="30px"></a></div></div></div><p class="txt-center txt-2">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &COPY; <span id="copyYear"
