Monagas, October 2023</p><h2 class="p-blog h9">Introducing Japanese style gardens and landscaping to residents in Calgary is an exciting venture. In prior years, both the news and the media have consistently reported that a typical household with a lawn consumes in excess of ten thousand gallons of water per year (a phenomenon known as "the hidden water waste in lawn maintenance").</h2><h3 class="p-blog h7">More interestingly is the fact that in dry climates like Calgary, especially during the hot summer months, many homeowners water their lawns more than necessary in an effort to maintaining their "green" appearance. This undoubtedly leads to a great deal of water waste via evaporation.</h3><h4 class="p-blog h9">Therefore, it is only rational to note that the adoption of dry gardens is nothing but one smart step towards a more sustainable future. Given that a dry garden is a landscape that is specifically created with drought tolerant plants that can survive with little to no irrigation, they are the perfect solution to "the water footprint of lawns in North America".</h4><p class="p-blog">One of the top selling points of this type of landscaping style is the fact that a dry garden requires less care and attention than a traditional lawn; which is just perfect for those homeowners who have limited time and a budget for their upkeeping. This can transform any space into a peaceful retreat within their own homes. Fortunately, here in Alberta, we have plants that can thrive in our climate and soil conditions while acting as eco-friendly ground cover. For example, our favorite replacement for lawn includes the "sedum" species (known as "stonecrops") and "woolly thyme" (known as "wild thyme"). Also, by incorporating key features like, for instance, pea gravel, rocks, stones and boulders, homeowners can add great value to the aesthetic appeal of their gardens while reducing the excessive need for water.</p><h3 class="p-blog h7">Japanese and Zen dry gardens are not only aesthetically appealing but also versatile. They can be designed to fit both outdoor and indoor spaces. With their adaptability, and low maintenance costs, they can contribute to increasing a real estate property resale value by 15% to 20%, which makes them a solid alternative for those homeowners who are considering long-term investment opportunities.</h3><p class="p-blog">Ishidoro Zen Gardens firmly believes there is beauty in austerity. Therefore, we design, build, and maintain Japanese style gardens and landscapes in Calgary. We consciously follow the principles of the craft while making the necessary adjustments to suit the climate and ecology of our region. Our work is a labor of love, with a deep appreciation of the Japanese aesthetics and the cultural values of simplicity and harmony with nature. </p></section></article></main><footer class="footer bg-steel"><div class="foot-nav"><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage">About</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="services.html" title="Go to Services">Services</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact">Contact</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms">Terms</a></div></div><div class="foot-nav"><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes">Themes</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions">Questions</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="news.html" title="Go to News">News</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts">Posts</a></div></div><div class="social-nav bg-white p-round"><div class="social-links"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Facebook" title="Facebook" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Twitter" title="Twitter" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Instagram" title="Instagram" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Blogger" title="Blogger" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Pinterest" title="Pinterest" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div></div><div class="p-blog"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &COPY; <span id="copyYear"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script></body></html>
