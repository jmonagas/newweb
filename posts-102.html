Monagas, November 2023</p><p class="tx-just p-all">Watering lawns and gardens is expensive and inefficient, especially in a dry region like Calgary. On the other hand, Japanese Zen dry gardens make use of boulders, stones, rocks, gravel, sand, and plants that can withstand drought conditions.</p><p class="tx-just p-all">According to the City of Calgary, some 30 percent of all residential water consumption is used for lawn and garden irrigation. In 2023, the average monthly water bill for a household was $111. If households reduce this expense by 30% during the summer months, they could save around $200 per year. With 356,225 families in Calgary (per the 2021 census), these savings are quite substantial.</p><p class="tx-just p-all">Furthermore, a study conducted at the University of Alberta suggests that incorporating green spaces can lead to a notable appreciation in property values in Edmonton, ranging from 5% to 15%. By applying this 5% increase to the average residential property value in Calgary, which amounted to $555,000 in 2023, it can be estimated that the addition of a Japanese Zen dry garden has the potential to enhance the value of a household by $27,750.</p><p class="tx-just p-all">Calgary's investment in Parks and Open Spaces has been on the rise since 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent. This means more funding is being allocated to enhance green areas for the communities. However, the introduction of Japanese Zen dry gardens in Calgary will require more planning, design, and collaboration. Homeowners, landscapers, gardeners, architects, engineers, city officials, community groups, and cultural organizations will all need to opt-in and work together to turn this vision into a reality.</p><h2 class="tx-just p-all h6">Japanese Zen dry gardens are exceptional in their ability to improve mental well-being, providing a serene sanctuary for relaxation and an enhanced quality of life. They help to cultivate a strong sense of community and offer spaces for social and cultural interactions. People from diverse backgrounds and age groups can find solace in connecting with nature in these peaceful environments. Moreover, these gardens can play a crucial role in driving the city's economic growth by creating employment opportunities and offering valuable services.</h2><p class="tx-just p-all">The goal is to maintain the health, beauty, and functionality of homes, parks, and public spaces, in order to foster a more sustainable, inviting, and inclusive Calgary in the face of the ongoing impact of Covid-19, the war between Russia and Ukraine, housing shortages, property tax hikes, the war between Israel and Hamas, inflation rates, and other challenges.</p><p class="tx-just p-all">We all know that the City of Lethbridge is internationally recognized, praised, and admired for its stunning Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden. Following Lethbridge's example, Calgary can create a vibrant Japanese Garden that benefits both residents and visitors alike while generating revenue from multiple sources such as: entrance fees, sales from gift shops, event rentals, and charitable donations. By embracing this ideal, Calgary can unlock its own potential and create a more vibrant and sustainable future.</p><h2 class="tx-just p-all h6">As an illustration, the Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden reported 43,808 visitors in 2021. By using this number as a baseline, a public Japanese style garden in Calgary, with an average entry fee of $12.50, could potentially earn over $500,000 in admission revenue alone. This income, in addition to the annual revenue from the Calgary Stampede events, could support the funding of more public, community, and cultural diversity initiatives. Notably, the Calgary Stampede attracted approximately 1.38 million attendees, including locals and tourists, in 2023, and reported a revenue of $13 million in 2022.</h2><p class="tx-just p-all">By applying the same financial principles and logic to local household economies, taking into account an average cost of $50,000 per residential landscape project, Calgary could potentially see a substantial boost in tax revenue. However, in order to get a more precise financial assessment, it would be essential to carry out a thorough feasibility study that considers the unique circumstances and market conditions in Calgary.</p><p class="tx-just p-all">Important Updates: The Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden generated an economic impact of ~$800,000 in 2023. The City of Calgary proposed a 4.4% property tax rate increase for 2023. Next, the City of Calgary council voted in favour of an increase of 5% to the property tax in 2024.</p></div></div></section><section class="sections bg-creamy"><div class="p-xtr"><div class="flex-box flex-evn gap-3 flex-wrap flex-grow"><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/loyalty-program.jpg" alt="Loyalty Reward Program" title="Loyalty Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/referral-program.jpg" alt="Referral Reward Program" title="Referral Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="p-xtr bg-forest"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage">Home</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="services.html" title="Go to Services">Services</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact">Contact</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms">Terms</a></li></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="news.html" title="Go to News">News</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes">Themes</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions">Questions</a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts">Posts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ishidoro+Zen+Gardens+Inc+-+Calgary,+AB/@51.0258958,-114.3789727,10z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0xa1aec10d35adaddd:0x888d2fd2823e785e!8m2!3d51.0276233!4d-114.087835!16s%2Fg%2F11svj5fypr?entry=ttu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Profile"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/profile.svg" alt="Connect Profile" title="Connect Profile" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="Connect LinkedIn" title="Connect LinkedIn" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Connect Facebook" title="Connect Facebook" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Connect Twitter" title="Connect Twitter" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Connect Instagram" title="Connect Instagram" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Connect Blogger" title="Connect Blogger" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Connect Pinterest" title="Connect Pinterest" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li><li><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/@IshidoroZenGardensInc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect YouTube"><img class="flex-box" loading="lazy" src="./img/youtube.svg" alt="Connect YouTube" title="Connect YouTube" width="25px" height="25px"></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="p-all"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &copy; <span id="copyYear" class="tx-white"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script><script type="application/ld+json">[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":["Article"] ,"headline":"Why Calgarians Should Be Embracing Japanese Zen Dry Gardens","datePublished":"2024-03-05T15:43:00+0000","dateModified":"2024-03-05T15:43:00+0000","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jose G.
