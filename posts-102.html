Monagas, November 2023</p><p class="p-all">Watering lawns and gardens can be costly and wasteful, especially in a dry climate like Calgary. In contrast, Japanese Zen dry gardens rely on boulders, stones, rocks, gravel, sand, and drought tolerant plants.</p><p class="p-all">According to the City of Calgary, some 30% of all residential water consumption is attributed to the irrigation of lawns and gardens. In 2023, the average water bill for a household was $111 per month. If we consider a reduction of 30% in this monthly expense during the summer months, the potential yearly savings for each household could be around $200. Given the 356,225 families residing in private households in Calgary, as per the 2021 census, these savings are quite substantial.</p><p class="p-all">Furthermore, research from the University of Alberta suggests that the inclusion of green spaces can boost property values in Edmonton by 5% to 15%. Applying this 5% increase to the average residential property value in Calgary, which was $555,000 in 2023, it can be inferred that the addition of a Japanese Zen dry garden could potentially enhance the property value per household by $27,750.</p><p class="p-all">It is a fact that the Calgary's total budget for Parks and Open Spaces has increased steadily as from 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent. However, building Japanese Zen dry gardens in Calgary will require more planning, designing, and collaboration among homeowners, landscapers, gardeners, architects, engineers, city officials, community groups, and cultural organizations.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">Outstandingly, Japanese Zen dry gardens can contribute to better mental health by providing opportunities for relaxation, which can lead to enjoying a higher quality of life. They also foster a stronger sense of community while promoting spaces for people to engage in social and cultural activities. They allow people of all ages, abilities and social backgrounds to connect with nature in a tranquil oasis. They can support the economic growth of the city by generating jobs and services.</h2><p class="p-all">The goal is to ensure that homes, parks, and public spaces remain healthy, beautiful, and functional, as a way to create a more sustainable, attractive, and inclusive Calgary despite the unfolding effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the Russia vs. Ukraine war, housing deficit, property tax increases, the Israel vs. Hamas war, inflation rates, etc.</p><p class="p-all">By following the example of the City of Lethbridge, which is renowned for its Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden, the City of Calgary could also tap into potential revenue streams such as entrance fees, sales from gift shops, event rentals, and charitable donations.</p><h2 class="p-all h5 tx-italic">For example, the Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden reported a total of 43,808 visitors in 2021. Using this figure as a benchmark, a public Japanese style garden in Calgary, with an average entry fee of $12.50, could potentially generate over $500,000 in admission revenue alone. This income, coupled with the annual revenue from the Calgary Stampede events, could contribute to funding more public, community, and cultural diversity initiatives. This is particularly noteworthy considering that the Calgary Stampede attracted approximately 1.38 million attendees, including locals and tourists, in 2023; and reported a revenue of $13 million in 2022.</h2><p class="p-all">Now, if we apply the same financial principles and logic to local household economies, with an average cost of $50 thousand per residential landscape project, Calgary could be earning a significant increase in tax revenue. Yet, for a more accurate financial analysis, it would be necessary to conduct a detailed feasibility study considering the specific circumstances and market conditions in Calgary.</p><p class="p-all">Important Updates: The Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden generated an economic impact of ~$800,000 in 2023. The City of Calgary proposed a 4.4 percent property tax rate increase for 2023.</p></div></div></section><section class="sections bg-creamy"><div class="p-xtr"><div class="flex-box flex-evn gap-3 flex-wrap flex-grow"><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/loyalty-program.jpg" alt="Loyalty Reward Program" title="Loyalty Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div><div><img loading="lazy" src="./img/referral-program.jpg" alt="Referral Reward Program" title="Referral Reward Program" width="300px" height="300px"></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="p-xtr bg-forest"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Home</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="services.html" title="Go to Services"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Services</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Contact</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Terms</li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="news.html" title="Go to News"><li class="tx-center foot-links">News</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Themes</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Questions</li></a><a class="tx-white" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts"><li class="tx-center foot-links">Posts</li></a></ul></div></div><div class="flex-box flex-ctr flex-wrap"><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="Connect LinkedIn" title="Connect LinkedIn" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Connect Facebook" title="Connect Facebook" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Connect Twitter" title="Connect Twitter" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div><div class="quarts p-all"><ul class="ul-none"><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Connect Instagram" title="Connect Instagram" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Connect Blogger" title="Connect Blogger" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a><a class="tx-white" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><li class="tx-center foot-links"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Connect Pinterest" title="Connect Pinterest" width="26px" height="26px"></li></a></ul></div></div></div><div class="p-all"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Go Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &copy; <span id="copyYear" class="tx-white"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script><script type="application/ld+json">{ "@context": "https://schema.org", "@ype": "LocalBusiness", "name": "Ishidoro Zen Gardens", "image": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/img/bookmark.jpg", "@id": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "url": "https://ishidorozengardens.com/", "telephone": "403-397-3696", "priceRange": "$$$", "address":{ "@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "10 Ave SW", "addressLocality": "Calgary", "addressRegion": "AB", "postalCode": "T2R0B6", "addressCountry": "CA"}, "openingHoursSpecification":{ "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification", "dayOfWeek": [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" ], "opens": "08:30", "closes": "17:30"}, "sameAs": [ "https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/", "https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen", "https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/", "https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens", "https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/", "https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/", "https://www.youtube.com/@IshidoroZenGardensInc" ]} </script></body></html>
