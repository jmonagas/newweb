It seeks to create aesthetically pleasing, structured gardens for recreation, socializing, or visual enjoyment. These gardens are typically segmented into defined zones, with neatly arranged paths and boundaries. The layout often reflects a desire to shape nature into a functional and pleasing space for human activities.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-001.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Design Basics</h4><p>Traditional North American gardens are often defined by formal, geometric patterns, such as symmetrical flower beds, trimmed hedges, and neat lawns. The layout is organized into "rooms" or zones, with pathways guiding visitors through the space. Decorative elements like statues, urns, and fountains reflect human creativity and design, serving as focal points within the garden.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-002.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Plant Assortment</h4><p>Traditional North American gardens feature a diverse range of plants, from vibrant flowers to ornamental grasses, creating a colorful, year-round display. Flower beds are often the centerpiece, with plants carefully selected to complement one another in terms of color and texture. Shrubs and trees are also used to enhance the visual appeal, but the emphasis is on variety and visual interest throughout the seasons. </p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-003.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Water Features</h4><p>Water features in traditional North American gardens are often used for decorative and functional purposes. Fountains, ponds, and swimming pools serve as focal points, enhancing the aesthetic appeal while providing spaces for relaxation or recreation. These elements are frequently embellished with decorative statues or tile work, designed to catch the eye and draw attention.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-004.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Hardscape Structures</h4><p>Traditional North American landscaping uses hard materials like stone, brick, and wood to define the structure of the garden. These materials are used for walkways, fences, patios, and walls, creating clear boundaries between different areas of the garden. The design tends to be more formal, with straight paths and geometric shapes that guide movement through the space.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-005.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Care and Upkeep</h4><p>Traditional North American gardens require regular maintenance, including mowing, trimming, and replanting. Flower beds and lawns need constant attention, and some gardens feature intricate designs, such as topiary or espaliered trees, which demand more frequent care. Fertilizers and pesticides are required to maintain plant health and ensure the garden remains lush and vibrant throughout the seasons.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-006.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Cultural Identity</h4><p>North American gardens often represent human mastery over nature.

These gardens reflect a desire to control nature and curate an outdoor space that serves human needs.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-007.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Color and Aesthetic</h4><p>Traditional North American gardens are characterized by bold colors and a wide variety of plant species. Flowers are chosen for their vivid hues, creating eye-catching displays throughout the year. The overall aesthetic is cheerful and vibrant, with high-contrast visuals designed to engage the senses. Each plant is selected for its contribution to the overall color scheme and texture of the garden.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-008.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Space and Scale</h4><p>Traditional North American gardens often cover large areas, with expansive lawns, flower beds, and garden rooms laid out for different activities. The design focuses on creating distinct zones for various purposes, such as seating areas, vegetable patches, or water features. Scale is considered, but the emphasis is on providing a multifunctional space for gatherings and outdoor activities.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-009.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Sustainability Issues</h4><p>Traditional North American landscaping can be resource-intensive, particularly when large lawns or extensive water features are involved. Maintaining a green lawn often requires significant water use and chemical treatments. These practices can raise concerns about sustainability and environmental impact, especially in water-scarce areas.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-010.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Value vs. Costs</h4><p>In Calgary, there are over 100 contractors offering their landscaping services, many of whom are trained in horticulture or design. It's important to note that traditional North American landscaping requires a significant investment in labor and materials. Additionally, ongoing expenses like watering, mowing, and pest control can increase utility bills. As a result, maintenance adds to the long-term financial commitment.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./traditional-landscaping/features-011.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Traditional Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h3>Traditional Japanese Style Landscaping</h3><h4 class="txt-left">Core Principles</h4><p>Influenced by Shintoism and Zen Buddhism, Japanese style landscaping is rooted in balance and harmony. It emphasizes working with nature rather than controlling it, creating serene spaces that evoke tranquility and reflection. These gardens are typically asymmetrical, with a focus on the impermanence of nature and creating an environment that feels spiritually enriching and calm.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-001.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Design Basics</h4><p>Japanese gardens embrace asymmetry and natural forms, creating a miniature, abstract landscape that reflects nature's beauty. Rocks, water, and carefully placed plants are key elements, and while the layout may appear random, it evokes a sense of natural harmony. In a traditional Japanese rock garden, for example, rocks represent mountains, and raked gravel symbolizes flowing water.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-002.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Plant Assortment</h4><p>In Japanese gardens, plant selection is restrained, with a focus on symbolism and seasonal beauty. Trees like pines and bamboo are used for their enduring qualities, while seasonal plants such as cherry blossoms and maples highlight the fleeting nature of life. Moss and low-growing plants help create soft ground coverings, enhancing the ambiance and reinforcing the concept of impermanence. </p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-003.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Water Features</h4><p>In Japanese gardens, water serves as a symbolic element, representing life, renewal, and tranquility. Ponds, streams, and koi fish are integrated into the landscape, designed to blend seamlessly with natural surroundings. The sound of flowing water is an integral part of the garden's vibe, creating a calming, meditative environment that encourages reflection.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-004.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Hardscape Structures</h4><p>Japanese gardens tend to integrate hardscaping elements in a way that feels organic and timeless. They favor natural, rustic materials that blend into the surrounding environment. Stone is used for pathways and rock gardens, while gravel is raked into patterns to symbolize water. Bamboo makes fences or decorative accents, contributing to the garden's overall beauty.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-005.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Care and Upkeep</h4><p>Japanese gardens are lower-maintenance but require mindful care. Features like gravel raking, pruning, and plant care demand attention to detail. In preserving the natural beauty of the garden, pruning is considered an art form. It helps enhance the natural shape of trees and shrubs rather than imposing an artificial form. This helps the garden retain its ambiance without becoming over-maintained.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-006.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Cultural Identity</h4><p>Japanese gardens have deep spiritual and philosophical significance. They are designed to evoke feelings of peace, contemplation, and connection with the natural world. Elements such as rocks symbolize mountains, and water represents the flow of life. They promote mindfulness, offering visitors a means to reflect on their journey.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-007.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Color and Aesthetic</h4><p>Japanese gardens prioritize muted, earthy tones. Greens, grays, and browns dominate the color palette, with occasional splashes of color from seasonal plants like cherry blossoms in spring or vibrant fall foliage. The focus is on creating a calm, reflective atmosphere, where the beauty of the garden is subtle and harmonious, rather than striking or overwhelming.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-008.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Space and Scale</h4><p>Japanese gardens, regardless of size, are designed to create the illusion of greater expansiveness. Techniques such as narrowing paths or layering plants help create a sense of depth and space. The goal is to evoke a feeling of quiet beauty and serenity, even in smaller gardens. Every element is placed with care to ensure a harmonious, tranquil ambiance.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-009.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Sustainability Issues</h4><p>Japanese gardens tend to be environmentally conscious, often utilizing native plants that require less water and maintenance. Water features are designed to be self-sustaining, and materials like moss and gravel reduce the need for excessive irrigation. The focus is on working with nature for sustainability and beauty.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-010.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section><section class="flex-column"><h4 class="txt-left">Value vs. Costs</h4><p>In Calgary, there are fewer contractors offering authentic Japanese style landscaping; many require specific horticulture, cultural, and philosophical training. It's worth mentioning that the upfront investment is comparable to traditional North American landscaping, while long-term maintenance is typically lower. Additionally, minimalist designs help conserve water and reduce overall upkeep. Consequently, maintenance costs are generally lower over time.</p></section><section class="main-sub-ctn"><img loading="lazy" class="img-wide" src="./japanese-landscaping/highlights-011.jpeg" width="1792" height="1024" alt="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes" title="Japanese Style Gardens and Landscapes"></section></article></main><footer><div class="foot-ctn"><section class="foot-div"><div class="foot-cell"><p class="h5 txt-bold pad-bot-05 underline">Choose Us</p><p class="pad-bot-05">Why wait another day to transform your outdoor space? &#129122; Book Your Appointment!</p><ul class="cell-list"><li>Ishidoro Zen Gardens Inc. alleviates Calgary's landscaping pains by designing, building and maintaining beautiful, low maintenance Japanese style gardens.</li></ul></div></section><section class="foot-div"><div class="foot-cell"><p class="h5 txt-bold pad-bot-05 underline">Contact Us</p><p class="pad-bot-05">Ishidoro Zen Gardens Inc: Calgary's own Japanese style landscaping company.</p><ul class="cell-list"><li>URL: <a href="https://ishidorozengardens.com/" title="Ishidoro Zen Gardens">www.ishidorozengardens.com</a></li><li>Reg.
