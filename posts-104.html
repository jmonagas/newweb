Monagas, December 2023</p><h2 class="p-blog h9">It may be just a trend, but residents in Calgary are talking about Japanese Zen dry gardens, and wonder what makes a Zen garden so different from western style gardens with lawns and flowers. </h2><p class="p-blog">For some, Zen dry gardens look simple and rather monochromatic. But, undoubtedly, this apparent simplicity can be quite deceptive; thus comparable to an iceberg, where much of the substance lies beneath the surface.</p><h3 class="p-blog h7">In my personal experience of over a decade of continuous search and learning, I have found that Zen dry gardens are no less than complex spaces with an all encompassing meaning that is as thought provoking and timeless as the pyramids for the ancient pharaohs and Egyptians. You will find in your own exploration journey that the concept of monotone (or limited color palette) in the context of Zen contributes to enhancing a garden's tranquility and aesthetic appeal.</h3><h3 class="p-blog h9">At this point, some might argue that the pyramids and Zen dry gardens have absolutely nothing in common because of their geographical and cultural distance. But the truth is that both share the purpose of guiding a person's mind towards higher realms of thought. And here is why: The minimalist design of Zen dry gardens causes the observer to go deep within themselves, while reflecting upon the essence of nature and the universe. The gravel, rocks, boulders, stones, shrubs and moss are just the canvas for exploring these philosophical concepts.</h3><p class="p-blog">In counter balance, the precise geometric design of the pyramids, with their celestial alignments and intricate internal structures, reflects the concept of balance and order as embodied by the ancient Egyptian goddess Ma'at. Therefore, the narrow ascending passage to the pharaoh's grand chamber in the pyramid can be regarded as the pathway leading to the ultimate liberation from the constraints of this physical world to the eternal or the afterlife.</p><h3 class="p-blog h7">In other words, both Zen dry gardens and pyramids can be viewed as mind tracks: Where Zen dry gardens lead the observer's mind on a path for contemplating the true nature of reality (i.e.: solitude and impermanence); while the pyramids help induce a person's focus on a journey about the immortality of their souls versus the apparent and transitory state of the deceased.</h3><p class="p-blog">To make it short, the cultural and geographical differences of these two vehicles, with their exquisite and symbolic meanings, inspire introspection on the eternal journey of the soul. And that is their secret and what makes them so fascinating to me personally; not just the ancient civilizations that imbued them with their profound philosophies and religious beliefs.</p><h3 class="p-blog h7">So, when creating your Zen dry garden, take your time to explore different designs and choose the elements that resonate with you the most. Focus on creating a special space that will promote your peace and tranquility. Each garden presents its own unique challenges and rewards. Luckily, there are no strict rules to follow.</h3><p class="p-blog">For example, the pure act of raking the sand (or pea gravel), and making patterns that reflect your mood and thoughts, can take your mind away of mundane problems, and help you relieve your stress. Yet, if you really do not enjoy this repetitive motion and focus, then you can simply sit quietly and breathe until your mind let go your anxiety.</p><p class="p-blog">If you prefer to enjoy your garden without doing any work, Ishidoro Zen Gardens Inc. can take care of the maintenance for you. We can do the weeding, trimming, pruning, shaping, picking up leaves and debris, raking the gravel, and more.</p></section></article></main><footer class="footer bg-steel"><div class="foot-nav"><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="index.html" title="Go to Homepage">About</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="services.html" title="Go to Services">Services</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="contact.html" title="Go to Contact">Contact</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="terms.html" title="Go to Terms">Terms</a></div></div><div class="foot-nav"><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="themes.html" title="Go to Themes">Themes</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="questions.html" title="Go to Questions">Questions</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="news.html" title="Go to News">News</a></div><div class="foot-links"><a class="tx-white p-round" href="posts.html" title="Go to Posts">Posts</a></div></div><div class="social-nav bg-white p-round"><div class="social-links"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ishidorozengardens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect LinkedIn"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/linkedin.svg" alt="LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ishidorozengardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Facebook"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/facebook.svg" alt="Facebook" title="Facebook" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ishidorozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Twitter"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/twitter.svg" alt="Twitter" title="Twitter" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ishidorozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Instagram"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/instagram.svg" alt="Instagram" title="Instagram" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://zen-landscaping-in-calgary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Blogger"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/blogger.svg" alt="Blogger" title="Blogger" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/ishidorozengardensinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Connect Pinterest"><img loading="lazy" src="./img/pinterest.svg" alt="Pinterest" title="Pinterest" height="35px" width="35px" /></a></div></div><div class="p-blog"><p class="tx-center"><a class="tx-white" href="index.html" title="Back to Homepage">Ishidoro Zen Gardens &COPY; <span id="copyYear"></span></a></p></div></footer><script defer src="./js/current_year.js"></script></body></html>
